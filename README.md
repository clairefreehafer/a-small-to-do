# a small to-do
## A simple task management app

a small to-do uses **Node** and **Express** on the backend for server management and API routing. The database is run using **postgreSQL** and **Sequelize** for the models. On the front are several **React** components utilizing **React Router** to list tasks, add tasks, mark tasks as complete, filter complete and incomplete tasks, and delete tasks. **Axios** allows API requests to be made from our components. **Webpack** packages it all up, and **React-Bootstrap** provides the styling.
